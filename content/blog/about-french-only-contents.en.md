Unfortunately, most of this website's content is only available in French. This includes :

* [Detailed explanations on Minimal Ethics, and more](/page/)
* [Criticisms and continuations of Ogien's work](/blog/)
* [An extended F.A.Q](/page/faq/)

If in despair, use an online translator. I probably won't translate any other part of the site myself.

## Ruwen Ogien's works in english

As far as I know, Ogien's work on Minimal Ethics weren't translated. Nonetheless, other parts of his work were, [and they're available on Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Ruwen-Ogien/e/B00IVBMJ4K/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1522496231&sr=8-1)

## I'm super motivated to translate

No you're not. You're drunk. Cool down, and come back shortly. If you're still into translating French content to English (or to whatever language you fancy), you can contact me :

Or even better, you can make a [git pull request](https://github.com/druxstr/ethique.xyz/tree/master/content) on Github.
