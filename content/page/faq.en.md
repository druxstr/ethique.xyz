## Ruwen Ogien's Minimal Ethics
<details id="defmorale">
  <summary> How does Minimal Ethics defines Ethics in genreal&nbsp;?</summary>

  Ethics is about how indivual freedoms can coexist, and what a fair social cooperation can look like. It concerns the relationships between persons that are neither ruled by force nor by threat.

  Answering "deep" or "existential" questions isn't a part of ethics. Ethics's mission isn't to shape every aspect of our life by telling us what to do.

  <summary>Are each of our actions either moral or immoral&nbsp;?</summary>

  No. That's not the spirit. In Minimal Ethics, an action either breaks a moral principle, or it has nothing to do with ethics. If you break one of the 3 moral principle stated by Ogien, you do something immoral. If you don't break any principle, what you're doing isn't "moral", it's just not moral related.

<details id="moral">
  <summary>Are some actions "morally good"&nbsp;?</summary>

  No. Minimal Ethics only demands that we do no harm and that we do not break the equal consideration principle. There are no "morally good" actions that we should do, like giving money to the poors or helping our neighbours.

<details id="autresmini">
  <summary>Can a theory be more minimal than the Minimal Ethics&nbsp;?</summary>

  Yes and no.

  *Yes*. A theory that would stick to the harm principle alone would be more minimal : it would have less principles.

  *No*. Minimal Ethics confines ethics to relation to *others*. It's hard to do less. But you can do more, for instance if you claim that the relation of one to himself has a moral relevance.

  *Yes and no (at the same time)*. If you extend ethics to one's relation to himself AND only admit the harm principle, you're both *less minimal* (you extend ethics to oneself) and *more minimal* than Ogien (you reject his 2 other principles).

## This website

<details id="argument">
  <summary>You don't provide Ogien's reasonings. Why&nbsp;?</summary>

  The website is an introduction to Ruwen Ogien's books. They're fun. You should read them. My point isn't to repeat them badly.

<details id="biblio">
  <summary>Is there a bibliography&nbsp;?</summary>

  Yes there is ! It's [on this page](/page/bibliographie). In French. I know.

<details id="english">
  <summary>What do I miss by not reading this site in French&nbsp;?</summary>

  Nothing, it's way funnier in English.

  More seriously, most of the content won't be translated. This includes [some dull pages](/page/) (Bibliography, Ogien's quotations on animals, etc.), a [longer version of this FAQ](/page/faq), and [deeper criticisms of Ogien's ethics](/blog/). If in despair, use an automatic translator.

  <summary>Who made this&nbsp;?</summary>

  I'm Guillaume Gallais, an ex-philosophy student in France. I've been reading Ruwen Ogien's works since 2003. I had the chance to meet him (once) and to read and criticize pre-print versions of his masterwork *L'éthique aujourd'hui* (*Ethics nowadays* - not translated as far as I know).
